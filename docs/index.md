# Kubernetes Architecture and Security Training

Welcome to the comprehensive Kubernetes Architecture and Security Training program!

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

This end-to-end training program covers everything from Kubernetes fundamentals through advanced security hardening. Built by practitioners with real-world experience, this material emphasizes:

- **Architecture**: Deep understanding of control plane, networking, storage, and operational patterns
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, pod security, admission control, and supply chain security
- **Operations**: High availability, disaster recovery, monitoring, logging, and incident response
- **Best Practices**: Production hardening, CIS benchmarks, and compliance

## 📚 Course Structure

### Part I: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
Build core Kubernetes knowledge through modules 01-04, covering basic resources, control plane architecture, networking fundamentals, and storage systems.

### Part II: Security (Weeks 3-4)
Master Kubernetes security with modules 05-10, including authentication, authorization, pod security, policy enforcement, observability, and supply chain security.

### Part III: Advanced (Weeks 5-6)
Achieve production readiness with modules 11-15, covering runtime security, incident response, compliance, multi-cluster patterns, and real-world case studies.

```

## 🗺️ Learning Paths

Choose your learning path based on your schedule and goals:

- **Intensive** (2 weeks full-time): 8 hours/day, complete all modules
- **Standard** (6 weeks part-time): 3-4 hours/day, balanced pace
- **Self-paced** (12 weeks): 1-2 hours/day, flexible schedule

**Total Time**: 65-80 hours including labs and assessments

## 📖 What's Included

- **16 Comprehensive Modules**: From basics to advanced security
- **Hands-on Labs**: Practical exercises with step-by-step instructions
- **Security Tools**: kube-bench, Falco, OPA, Trivy, and more
- **Real Examples**: Production-ready YAML manifests and configurations
- **Assessments**: Quizzes and practical challenges
- **Diagrams**: Architecture visualizations and flow charts

## 🔒 Security-First Approach

Every module emphasizes security best practices:

- Secure configurations from the start
- Defense-in-depth strategies
- Least privilege access control
- Practical threat mitigation
- CIS Kubernetes Benchmark alignment
- NSA/CISA hardening guidelines
